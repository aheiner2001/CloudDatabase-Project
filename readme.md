## Overview

**Project Title**: Personal Cloud Database

**Project Description**: This project is a simple web application that allows users to add to a list of items

**Project Goals**: .The orinal idea was going to be a recipie list with difference meals that you could add but I ended up switching it to a cool name list since it required much more time than i have in this sprint. However I feel I have done most of the heavy lifting this sprint and will now beable to focus on trying to make a more complete app.
