## Overview

**Project Title**: Personal Cloud Database

**Project Description**: This project is a web application that allows users to add, view, and delete recipes from a personal cloud database. The application is built using Flask for the backend and MySQL for the database.

**Project Goals**: The main goal of this project is to provide a simple and user-friendly interface for managing personal recipes. Users can add new recipes, view a list of existing recipes, and delete recipes they no longer need.

## Instructions for Build and Use

Steps to build and/or run the software:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required Python packages using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Set up the MySQL database and update the environment variables for database connection.
4. Run the Flask application using `python app.py`.

Instructions for using the software:

1. Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000`.
2. Use the form to add new recipes to the list.
3. View the list of recipes on the main page.
4. Delete recipes using the delete button next to each recipe.
